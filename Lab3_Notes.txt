1. Data Overview (DONE)
unem has 336 more obs than auto
2. Time Series Overview
### Time plots and Histograms
unem.ts : persistency, unusual spikes (due to recession)
auto.ts : less persistent than unem. stronger seasonal jots 


### Make into TS and plot

### Make into histogram

### Smoothing

- MA filter, Kernel Smmo

- Identify Trend

### Decompose 




## Establish Stationarity

## Seasonality and Autocorrelation

### Examine month plot (aggregate by month)

### Scatterplot matrix with itself

Seasonal Differencing? Identify Seasonality

- Examine acf and pacf

- test for unit root (adf test, pp test)

- Difference it once

- plot the differenced ts

First Differencing? Identify if random walk or random walk with drift

- Examine acf and pacf from seasonally differenced ts

- test for unit root again (adf test, pp test)

- Difference it once more

- plot the differenced ts

- Look stationary? (Ljung-Box test)

- Examine acf and pacf

- eyeball AR, MA components





## Examine Bivariate Relationship

- intersect the two time series

### ts Plot overlap two series

### Examiine ccf and ccd

### Scatterplot matrix with each other

### Did we get unit-roots above?
--Yes --> test for co-integration (po.test) (VECM, or difference both and do VAR)
--Yes --> try to difference the two and examine the linear combo as a ts, acf and pacf

### Take first difference and suggest VAR



Q3. 
W10 Live Notes --> Why SARIMA may be better than VAR.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Take away



both series exhibit some degrees of seasonal and random walk/long memory process behavior. 
To estab seasonality
Primary suggestion for unem is no seasonal difference, take unit root
(ACF scatterplot matrix)(unit root test result)
Primary suggestion for auto is take seasonal difference, don't take unit root
(ACF scatterplot matrix)(unit root test result rejects in all cases)




How to VAR?
auto clearly lags behind unem --> doesn't make much sense to use auto info
don't strongly suggest unit root in both TS
cointegration test yes
but regressing unem on auto is not informative, residuals behavior are poor. linear combo is not strong
