1. Data Overview (DONE)
unem has 336 more obs than auto

2. Time Series Overview

### Time plots and Histograms
unem.ts : persistency, unusual spikes (due to recession)
auto.ts : less persistent than unem. stronger seasonal jots. two plunges corresponding to unem.ts recessions. spike in 1986 due to oil prices drop


(persistent)
(clear outlier, examine) (continuous from persistent trend not errorneous, correspond to the early 1980s recession in the US which ended in November 1982). second peak correspond to the Great recession which officially lasted from Dec 2007 - June 2009)


From the above time plot of unemployment, we see clear persistency of the observations. That is, when observations are above or below the mean, they tend to stay so for a while. The overall trend seem to climb slowly upward. There are a noticeable number of observations lying 2.5 standard deviations above the mean, which is made obvious in the right skewed histogram as well. We isolated these observations, the 6 in 1982 and 1983 probably correspond to the early 1980s recessions which officially ended in November 1982. The 3 in 2010 probably correspond to the late 2000s recession which officially ended in June 2009.

(A Sharp Spike in 1980s)
(less persistent than employment rate)
(two plunges in the early 1980s and 2009 respond to recessions)
(one spike in 1986 due to oil prices plunged in more than half that year)

From the above time plot of auto sales, we see some but weaker persistency than the unemployment series. The overall trend doesn't seem to climb upward or downward. There are more noticeable seasonal patterns than the unemployment series. The histogram is more symmetric and normal. Less than 1.5% observations lie 2 standard deviations above the mean and less than 2.5% observations lie 2 standard deviations below the mean.  We isolated 
these observations, the 5 in 1982 and 1983 and the 5 in 2008 and 2009 probably correspond to the two aforementioned recessions. Notice that these recession related observations in auto sales tend to happen a few months before those in unemployment. There is an unusual spike in 1986, probably attributed to oil prices dropping in half that year.


### Smoothing and Decomposition

Unem MA and kernel:

The asymmetric moving average filters above average over the past 6 months, 12 months and 4 years. The symmetric kernel smoothers attempted 3 bandwidths. In either case, the smoothed series resemble behavior of random walks with drift, evidence by the gradually widened variance and slowly increasing mean towards the right. Formulation for the two smoothers are given here:

Unem Decomposition :

The decomposed trend series resembles that of the moving average and kernel filters. Here the growing variance of the trend is more noticeable, as well as the gradual upward trend. A regular, annual seasonality series was isolated out from the raw series. The random component series is clearly non-stationary. Its variance diminishes over time featured by dramatic spikes before 1965. Clearly, an OLS model would not be the right choice, we should not disregard the non-stationary trend and random components.

Auto MA and kernel:

Compared to the unemployment series, the auto sale series exhibit less downhill-uphill-downhill behavior, and appear to be relatively stable between the two aforementioned recessions in early 1980s and late 2000s. It resembles less of a random walk and drift is not entirely apparent. Seasonal pattern is also stronger. Below, we plotted the two series at the same time interval and kernel bandwidth for direct comparison.

Auto Decomposition :

(Decomposition Assumption, Findings of Noise of Inconsistent Variance)
(Trend is sloght upward trend, doesn't look like a random walk. Compared to unemployment it is more stable)
(Seasonality seem regular)
(Noise is clearly not stationary)
(We cannot use regression mode)

The trend component observed in the decomposed series concur with our intuitions from the smoothed series. With the seasonal component taken out, the random component show a spike in mid-1980s and several more in 2000s, both of which may correspond to respective oil price fluctuations. In general, the random component series shows higher variance before mid-1980s than after, which we have also observed in the unemployment series. The decomposed components are clearly not stationary, which against suggest that OLS is not appropriate. 



3. Establish Stationarity


## Seasonality and Autocorrelation -- Unem

month plot 332

(monthly plot shows higher values in the beginning and mid year)
(can difference it in SARIMA, if linear regression should use dummy for Jan Feb and Jun July)

The monthly plot show some seasonal pattern at the mean, but the range of unemployment variation for each month also overlap a lot with other months. So the seasonal pattern exists but is not very strong. We see that unemployment rate tend to be a little higher in the beginning and middle of each year followed by mild gradual decrease.

scatterplot 338

(weak seasonality, probably no need for seasonal difference)
(strongest correlation with first lag, then weaker and weaker lags)

The above scatterplot shows that the series is most correlated with its first lag, then correlations grow weaker and the point clouds becomes more scattered with larger lags without any sign of picking up at lag 12. 

(weak seasonality, probably no need for seasonal difference)
(strongest correlation with first lag, then weaker and weaker lags)


acf, pacf 344

(acf slow decay, random walk with drift)
(some sign of seasonality -- note the local peak at lag 12, 24, 36, 48)

(pacf most significant at lag 1 can be AR(1))
(pacf also show sign at lag 12, 25,37,49 , can be a seasonal MA component)

The acf shows slow decay from lag 0 coupled with a sharp drop of pacf after lag 1. This is a sign of an AR(1) process. We see minor local ripples on the acf at lag 12, 24, 36 and 48 which indicate seasonal effects. The significant, negative pacfs which tails off at lag 13, 25, 37, 49 suggest a seasonal MA component. Some smaller significant pacf values within the first 12 lags suggest either some AR processes or an MA process in that range.

Although there are some seasonal effects in the unemployment series, they don't seem strong enough to require seasonal differencing. To help us determine, we compare the seasonal differenced and first differenced series and compare their behaviors using time and autocorrelation plots.

(TS plot 1st diff, 12th diff) 385

The seasonally differenced series retained most of the random walk like behavior in the raw series and appear more persistent before mid 1980s. The first differenced series eliminated most random walk and persistent behaviors but variance is generally larger before 1980. There is still a slight downward trend (green regression line) with the seasonal differenced series. (red line refers to 2 standard deviation marks)

(acf, pacf of 12th diff) 396

(pacf sees sign lags 13, 25, 37 without much echo of graudal positive decay in acf --> seasonal MA(1) )
(Seasonal Differencing may not be necessary --> Seasonal MA(1) can be a sign that we have over differenced the series)
(pacf sharp drop lag 1, echoed by acf gradual drop from lag 1, AR(1))
(pacf some sign lags 2-4, can be AR(2-4) components, hard to tell from acf, let model loop judge)

Above plots: In the seasonal differenced series, we still see a significant pacf at lag 1 followed by a sharp drop and gradual decay in the acf. Notice the significant pacfs in lags 13, 25, 37 as well. This suggest AR(1) process in combination with seasonal AR(3), or in combination with some seasonal ARMA processes. Notice a couple significant pacfs between lag 2 to 4, they can be AR(2-4) components but hard to tell at this stage. We may entertain the model as a SARIMA(4,0,q)(3,1,Q) using these plots.

(acf, pacf of 1st diff) 406

(long memory seasonal AR(1) and seasonal MA(1))
(pacf show some significance lag 2-9 , without much echo in acf --> let loop figure it out)
possible SARIMA(9,1,q)(1,0,1)

Above plots: In the first differenced series, the plots show much stronger periodic behavior, the extended plot show that acf tails off until lag 720, which suggest either a seasonal long memory or seasonal integrated process (both SAR(1)) in combination with some sesonal AR(2-4) components or in combination with a seasonal MA component. The pacf show some significance between lag 2-9 without a little echo in the acf lag 13-16, which can come from some MA processes but it's hard to say at this stage. We simply assume some ARMA processes present. We may entertain the model as a SARIMA(9,1,q)(4,0,Q) using these plots.

Two possible transformations -- SARIMA(4,0,q)(P,1,1), SARIMA(9,1,q)(1,0,1), 

Unit root tests 418

We perform unit root tests below to check for stationarity. Augmented Dicky Fuller Test and Phillips Perron Tests are performed, with the following test hypotheses:

Specifically in the ADF test, our null hypothesis assume that the process is a random walk with drift and some AR(p) components,$x_t = \beta_0 + \phi x_{t-1} + \sum_{j=1}^{p-1}\psi_j x_{t-j}  + w_t$, where $\beta_0$ represents the drift and $\phi = 1$. We are essentially testing the null hypothesis $\gamma = 0$ in the differenced series $\nabla x_t = \gamma x_{t-1} +  \sum_{j=1}^{p-1}\psi_j \nabla x_{t-j}  + w_t$ since $\gamma = \phi - 1$. Under the alternative hypothesis $\gamma < 0$.

In the Philips Perron test, our null hypothesis assume a model $x_t = \beta_0 + \rho_1 x_{t-1} + u_t$, where non-parametric correction is applied on $\rho$ to correct for serial correlation in $u_t$ already. We are essential testing of $\rho = 1$ in the null hypothesis.

As expected with the raw series, the ADF test failed to reject the null hypothesis that the series contains a unit root. The PP test results contradicts but we acknowledge that the test mechanism is different and that some early literature (Davidson and Mackinnon 2004) showed that ADF performs better in finite sample than PP test. All tests on both the seasonal differenced and first differenced series rejected the null hypothesis to support stationarity of the series.

All the tests rejected the null hypothesis that the first differenced or seasonal differenced series contains a unit root and supports stationarity. We should not need to difference the raw series with both procedures.

Unem Conclusion 434

Unemployment series stationarity conclusion: The month plot, scatterplot matrix and autocorrelation plots suggest some but weak seasonality of our raw series, along with strong random walk behavior. The time plots, acf and pacf plots of the seasonal differenced series strongly suggest AR(1) process and that of the first differenced series strongly suggest seasonal AR(1) process. The unit root test suggested that we don't need to do both differencing. We may give slightly higher preference to a first differenced series with a long memory seasonal AR(1) component, but should still consider a seasonal differenced series as a candidate.


## Seasonality and Autocorrelation -- Auto

Month Plot 450

(monthly plot shows more discrete values)

Compared to that of unemployment rate, monthly plot of auto sales show much more discrete values in the mean. So the seasonal pattern is much stronger. We see that autosales tend to be noticeably lower in the first two months, picks up sharply in March, steps up and down for the rest of the year. Fall sales are generally lower than summer sales.

Scatterplot 449 

(seasonality is much stronger. clearly correlated with lag 12)

Scatterplot matrix of auto sales with its own lags display clear seasonal dependence. Autocorrelation is highest with lag 12, that is this month last year, even more so compared to lag 1. The opposite patterns was observed in the unemployment rates series, when autocorrelation is highest with lag 1 and then gradually declines towards higher lags.

acf, pacf 456

(acf slow decay but show clearn local maximum at lag 12, 24, 36 , 48)
(pacf show sign at lag 1 and 12, AR(1) and SAR(1))

Similar to the unemployment series, the acf shows slow decay from lag 0, a sharp drop of pacf after lag 1 and some local acf maximums at lag 12, 24, 36 and 48. Unlike the unemployment series, the acf decay ends earlier at lag 36. The local maxima have much stronger profiles. Some significant pacf values occur before lag 12 which suggest either some AR or MA components(effects on acf plot is not discernable) in that range.

Based strong seasonal pattern in the above three plots, seasonal differencing would be useful in achieving stationarity. To help us determine, we again compare the seasonal differenced and first differenced series and compare their behaviors using time and autocorrelation plots.

TS plots (diff 1 diff 12) 462 

The seasonally differenced series noticeably removed the strong seasonal patterns and some degree of persistency from the raw series. The first differenced series removed most persistencies from the raw series but appear clustered regularly at seasonally intervals. Both series removed the upward trend in the raw series effectively.

(acf, pacf of 12th diff) 498

(pacf sees sign lags 13, 25, 37 without much echo of graudal positive decay in acf --> seasonal MA(1) )
(Seasonal Differencing may not be necessary --> Seasonal MA(1) can be a sign that we have over differenced the series)
(pacf sharp drop lag 1, echoed by acf gradual drop from lag 1, AR(1))
(pacf some sign lags 2-4, can be AR(2-4) components, hard to tell from acf, let model loop judge)


Above plots: In the seasonal differenced series, we still see a significant pacf at lag 1 followed by a sharp drop and gradual decay in the acf. Notice the significant pacfs in lags 13, 25, 37 as well. This suggests an AR(1) process in combination with seasonal AR(3), or in combination with some seasonal ARMA processes. Notice a couple significant pacfs between lag 2 to 4, they can be AR(2-4) components but hard to tell at this stage. We may entertain the model as a SARIMA(4,0,q)(3,1,Q) using these plots.


(pacf Still see -ve autocorrelation on Lag 1,2 and 3, acf after lag 3 shows gradual decay --> can be seasonal AR(3))
(pacf still see sharp drop at lag 1 and acf still see graudual decay from lag 1)
(pacf see sign, gradual drop lag 2-5, can be a MA(1) as well)

Above plots: Similar to unmployment rate, in the seasonal differenced serie of auto sales, we still see a significant pacf at lag 1 followed by a sharp drop and gradual decay in the acf. Notice the significant pacfs in lag 12, 24 and 36. This suggests an AR(1) process in combination with seasonal AR(3). Also notice a few significant pacfs at lags 2-4. We may entertain the model as a SARIMA(4,0,q)(3,1,Q) using these plots.


Unit root tests 511

We perform unit root tests below to check for stationarity again. Augmented Dicky Fuller Test and Phillips Perron Tests are performed, with the following test hypotheses:


(acf, pacf of 1st diff) 543

Above plots: Similar to unmployment rate, in the first differenced serie of auto sales, the acf tails off very slowly until lag 360. Unlike that of the unemployment series, the seasonal ripples on the acf appear much stronger. This plots suggest a strong seasonal AR(1) component and some AR(p) components before lag 12. 

Auto sales series stationarity conclusion: The month plot, scatterplot matrix and autocorrelation plots suggest strong seasonality of our raw series. The time plots, acf and pacf plots of the seasonal differenced series suggest an AR(1) component and that of the first differenced series suggests a strong seasonal AR(1) process. The unit root tests suggest that we don't need to do first or both differencing. We may give higher preference to a seasonal differenced series with an AR(1) component, but may still entertain a first differenced series as a candidate.




### Examine month plot (aggregate by month)

### Scatterplot matrix with itself

Seasonal Differencing? Identify Seasonality

- Examine acf and pacf

- test for unit root (adf test, pp test)

- Difference it once

- plot the differenced ts

First Differencing? Identify if random walk or random walk with drift

- Examine acf and pacf from seasonally differenced ts

- test for unit root again (adf test, pp test)

- Difference it once more

- plot the differenced ts

- Look stationary? (Ljung-Box test)

- Examine acf and pacf

- eyeball AR, MA components
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




## Examine Bivariate Relationship

- intersect the two time series

### ts Plot overlap two series

### Examiine ccf and ccd

### Scatterplot matrix with each other

### Did we get unit-roots above?
--Yes --> test for co-integration (po.test) (VECM, or difference both and do VAR)
--Yes --> try to difference the two and examine the linear combo as a ts, acf and pacf

### Take first difference and suggest VAR



Q3. 
W10 Live Notes --> Why SARIMA may be better than VAR.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Take away



both series exhibit some degrees of seasonal and random walk/long memory process behavior. 
To estab seasonality
Primary suggestion for unem is no seasonal difference, take unit root
(ACF scatterplot matrix)(unit root test result)
Primary suggestion for auto is take seasonal difference, don't take unit root
(ACF scatterplot matrix)(unit root test result rejects in all cases)




How to VAR?
auto clearly lags behind unem --> doesn't make much sense to use auto info
don't strongly suggest unit root in both TS
cointegration test yes
but regressing unem on auto is not informative, residuals behavior are poor. linear combo is not strong
