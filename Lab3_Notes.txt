EDA

- Both time series 

## Time series Overvview

### Make into TS and plot

### Make into histogram

### Smoothing

- MA filter, Kernel Smmo

- Identify Trend

### Decompose 


## Establish Stationarity

## Seasonality and Autocorrelation

### Examine month plot (aggregate by month)

### Scatterplot matrix with itself

Seasonal Differencing? Identify Seasonality

- Examine acf and pacf

- test for unit root (adf test, pp test)

- Difference it once

- plot the differenced ts

First Differencing? Identify if random walk or random walk with drift

- Examine acf and pacf from seasonally differenced ts

- test for unit root again (adf test, pp test)

- Difference it once more

- plot the differenced ts

- Look stationary? (Ljung-Box test)

- Examine acf and pacf

- eyeball AR, MA components





## Examine Bivariate Relationship

- intersect the two time series

### ts Plot overlap two series

### Examiine ccf and ccd

### Scatterplot matrix with each other

### Did we get unit-roots above?
--Yes --> test for co-integration (po.test) (VECM, or difference both and do VAR)
--Yes --> try to difference the two and examine the linear combo as a ts, acf and pacf

### Take first difference and suggest VAR



Q3. 
W10 Live Notes --> Why SARIMA may be better than VAR.
